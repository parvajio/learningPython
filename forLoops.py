# for loops = execute a block of code a fixed number of times.
#               You can iterate over a range, string, sequence, etc.

# for x in range(1, 11):
#     print(x)

# for x in reversed(range(1, 11)):
#     print(x)
#
# print("Happy")

# for x in range(1,11,4):
#     print(x)

# my_name = "parvaj"
# for spell in my_name:
#     print(spell)

# for x in range(1, 6):
#     if x == 3:
#         continue #breack (if want to stop here)
#     else:
#         print(x)
